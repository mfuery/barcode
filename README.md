# Dev

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ba480678-a9e2-46ec-aa83-dc2cd895e1dd/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/productbarcode/deploys)

This is a basic react app üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It uses Yarn.

```
yarn i
yarn start
```

Lots of console logging is still in the code, as this is a prototype.

# Next Steps

- QR codes. A phone camera detects QRs much more quickly and accurately.
